* This day I was able to learn about wht AAC devices are and their functionality in the lives of people especially the people who have disabilities.
* I was able to think a viable project where people can actually learn as well as a useful device which will enhance their brain functionality.
* Did a huge amount of research on AAC devices.
* Had a meeting with the boss of Evocube technologies
# end of day 1

# Day 2(10/5/23)
* well, on this day I mde a presentation on the AAC device which I am going to develop.
* it is mid tech device named TalkBox which is communication device which uses tactile feeback to give auditory output
* after the presentation, i was told to start making designs for the project. 
* to make designs for this project, I had to install Autodesk fusion 360, wher I could make 3D designs for my project.(took a very long time to download)
* After that i downloaded ultimaker cura which is the 3D printing machine in the lab.
* Downloaded a few 3d models from from the internet to trty out in the 3D printer but I was unable to due to time constraints
